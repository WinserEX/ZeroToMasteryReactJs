React is less complex which allows you to build better apps faster.

React is Component based. They are resusable just like "Lego Blocks".

You can access different component libraries.

State describes app data and status, state shapes components. 

State > Onde way dataflow > Component: Easier to debug.

React contains 2 libraries: React and ReactDOM

React main concepts:

Declarative, State, JSX, Props, Components, VirtualDOM

Be great at React:

1- Decide on Components.
2- Decide the State and where it lives.
3-What changes when the State changes.
